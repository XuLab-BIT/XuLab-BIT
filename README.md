  Dr. Fan Xu is a Professor at the Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Science, Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). He earned his B.S. in Computer Science and Technology at BIT in 2011 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017. Before joining BIT, Dr. Xu worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow and Senior Research Associate in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University.

  His research focuses on the development and application of super-resolution microscopy techniques, particularly in 3D super-resolution imaging and single-molecule localization analysis. He combines novel imaging instruments with physical models and data-driven approaches to investigate cellular and tissue structures and dynamics that are below the diffraction limit of light, making them inaccessible to conventional microscopy.
