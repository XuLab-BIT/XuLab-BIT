### Fan Xu

Professor

ADVANCED RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE, Beijing Institute of Technology

Dr. Xu is a Professor in the Advanced Research Institute of Multidisciplinary Sciences at Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT). Fan Xu earned his B.S. in Computer Science and Technology at BIT in 2011 and his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Technology from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017. Before joining BIT, Dr. Xu worked with Fang Huang as a Postdoctoral Fellow and Senior Research Associate in the Weldon School of Biomedical Engineering at Purdue University.

His research focuses on the development and application of super-resolution microscopy techniques, especially in 3D super-resolution imaging and single molecule localization analysis. He combines novel imaging instruments and physical model or data-driven approaches to investigate cellular/tissue structures and dynamics that are below the diffraction limit of light and therefore inaccessible to conventional microscopy.
